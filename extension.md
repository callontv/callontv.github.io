Here you can find the CallOnTV extension for Google Chrome. This extension needs to be installed on the Chromium browser on your Raspberry Pi, and it will automatically connect the Raspberry Pi to the default Google Meet session or admit people to the ongoing meeting.

The source code of the Google Chrome extension can be found on our [github repository](https://github.com/callontv/googlemeet-extension).

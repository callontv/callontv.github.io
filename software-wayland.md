You may need to enable HDMI-CEC in the settings of your TV e.g. on LG TVs.

Install cec-utils and wtype

cec-utils is used to control the TV using HDMI-CEC

Screen blanking needs to be disabled in Raspberry Pi configuration as it sometimes causes the speakers to have no voice.

wtype is used to press a key whenever needed

```
apt-get install cec-utils wtype -y
```

configure `/usr/local/bin/tv`

```
#!/bin/bash

case $1 in

on)
  echo 'on 0' | cec-client -s -d 1
;;
hdmi)
  echo 'as' | cec-client -s -d 1
;;
status)
  echo 'pow 0' | cec-client -s -d 1
;;
off)
  echo 'standby 0' | cec-client -s -d 1
;;
scan)
  echo 'scan' | cec-client -s -d 1
;;
*)
  echo "usage: tv status|on|hdmi|off|scan"
;;
esac
```

grant pi user to run the following commands in `/etc/sudoers.d/pi`

```
pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:SETENV: /usr/bin/wtype
```

Install required python modules:

```
pip3 install selenium pychrome
```

Grant access of the pi user to cec hdmi port in /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules

```
KERNEL=="cec*", GROUP="pi", OWNER="pi"
```

Finally, you need to have access to the internet plan you use remotely to check the remaining amount of your internet package and recharge it if needed.

Itâ€™s best to connect your Brio camera and your other USB devices to a powered USB 3.0 hub such as TP-Link UH700 or TP-Link UH720 to avoid hitting the power limit in Raspberry Pi USB ports.

You may need to add the following to /boot/cmdline.txt if your [bluetooth mouse is laggy](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=84999#p600742).


```
usbhid.mousepoll=0
```

Check the Input/Output of your sound device in Chromium / VLC and ensure it is set to HDMI. Sometimes the default sound output is set to DVI which causes HDMI to have no sound.

To-check list

- Check if there is any difference in CPU usage among 30Hz vs 60Hz HDMI output
- Check the performance on 32bit OS vs 64bit
